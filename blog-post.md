# Caleb's Favorite Vacation Destination
### Writen By: Caleb Coughenour

Do you have a favorite place to visit? Maybe it brings back memories of happy times with family or a place that brings you joy and peace. Whatever place you choose, it's special to you. 

My favorite place to visit is Homosassa Springs in Florida. More specifically, I like visiting their [Wildlife State Park](https://www.floridastateparks.org/parks-and-trails/ellie-schiller-homosassa-springs-wildlife-state-park)! 

One of my **favorite** things they have is their underwater observatory they've dubbed "The Fish Bowl".

>The Fish Bowl underwater observatory floats in the main spring and allows an up-close view of the spring and the fish and manatees. A live-feed television screen is located on the sundeck, allowing visitors to view fish and manatees from an underwater perspective.

And there's _so much to do_ you won't get bored!

* Birding
* Wildlife Viewing
* Hiking/Nature Trail
* Picnics
* Tours

And then there's the **Manatees**!
