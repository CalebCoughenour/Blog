# Caleb's Favorite Vacation Destination
### Writen By: Caleb Coughenour

Do you have a favorite place to visit? Maybe it brings back memories of happy times with family or a place that brings you joy and peace. Whatever place you choose, it's special to you. 

My favorite place to visit is Homosassa Springs in Florida. More specifically, I like visiting their [Wildlife State Park](https://www.floridastateparks.org/parks-and-trails/ellie-schiller-homosassa-springs-wildlife-state-park)! 

One of my **favorite** things they have is their underwater observatory they've dubbed "The Fish Bowl".

>The Fish Bowl underwater observatory floats in the main spring and allows an up-close view of the spring and the fish and manatees. A live-feed television screen is located on the sundeck, allowing visitors to view fish and manatees from an underwater perspective.

And there's _so much to do_ you won't get bored!

* Birding
* Wildlife Viewing
* Hiking/Nature Trail
* Picnics
* Tours

And then there's the **Manatees**!

The manatee come every winter to swim in the natural spring waters that are naturally kept above 70Â°F, which keep them happy and warm during the cold season. If you go during the winter, you're sure to see a lot of them swimming around the waters.

Don't forget about Lu, their residential, 6,000LB Hippo! He's been with the park since the 70's when the park was also used to house animal TV actors, before the park was even a state park. He's even an _honorary citizen of Florida_:

>Lu, a hippopotamus, was one of the Ivan Tors animals and still resides at the park after being declared an honorary citizen of the state of Florida by then Governor Lawton Chiles. 

If you ever get the chance to visit Central Florida, Homosassa Springs State Park should be on your list of to-do's!
