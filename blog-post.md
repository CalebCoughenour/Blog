# Caleb's Favorite Vacation Destination
### Writen By: Caleb Coughenour

Do you have a favorite place to visit? Maybe it brings back memories of happy times with family or a place that brings you joy and peace. Whatever place you choose, it's special to you. 

My favorite place to visit is Homosassa Springs in Florida. More specifically, I like visiting their Wildlife State Park!
